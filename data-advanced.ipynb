And so various data validation methods have appeared that will fail loudly and proudly when your data are not as expected. Although most useful in a situation where data are being regularly updated, for example when producing a monthly index, these tools can also be useful if you want to be extra careful with your data in a research paper, if you are scaling up from a sample to a bigger dataset, or if you are updating an existing project.\n",

That's about *data type*, but these tools go beyond that and deal with values *within* a data type. So rather than just saying it's an integer, a data validation library might say that a column must be an integer between 0 and 100.\n",

        "\n",
        "Data orchestration is the automation of data-driven processes from end-to-end, including preparing data, making decisions based on that data, and taking actions based on those decisions. Think of a data pipeline in which you extract data (perhaps from files), transform it somehow, and load it into where you want to put it (downstream in your research process, or perhaps into an app). \n",
        "\n",
        "There are some truly amazing tools out there to help you do this on a production scale. Perhaps the best known and most suited for production are AirBnB's [**Airflow**](http://airflow.incubator.apache.org/) and Spotify's [**Luigi**](https://github.com/spotify/luigi). Airflow in particular is widely used in the tech industry, and doesn't just schedule data processes in Python: it can run processes in pretty much whatever you like. Both of these tools try to solve the 'plumbing' associated with long-running batch processes on data: chaining tasks, automating them, dealing with failures, and scheduling. Both Luigi and Airflow have fancy interfaces to show you what's going on with your tasks. \n",
        "\n",
        "Data orchestration tools typically have a directed acyclic graph, a DAG, at the heart of how tasks are strung together. This defines how different tasks depend on each other in order, with one task following from the previous one (or perhaps following from multiple previous tasks). It's an automation dream.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, for a research project, it's hard to recommend these two tools as they're just a bit too powerful; Airflow in particular can do just about anything but has a steep learning curve. So, instead, to show the power of data orchestration we'll use a more lightweight but also very powerful library: [**dagster**](https://dagster.io/), which bills itself as 'a data orchestrator for machine learning, analytics, and ETL [extract, transform, and load]'. Some of the key features are being able to implement components in various tools, such as Pandas and SQL, define pipelines as DAGs, and to test the same setup on your machine that you then deploy to cloud. Like the other tools, it has a nice visual interface to show what's happening. Necessarily, we'll only be seeing a very brief introduction to it here.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Dagster** works by using *function decorators* (the `@` symbol) to define the 'solids' that are the nodes in **dagster**'s DAG. The `@pipeline` defines the set of functions that are composed in the pipeline. Here's an example of defining a simple pipeline that produces the same phrase with different capitalisations:"
